## System

### Time
  * **SNTP**
    	Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.

    **systemd-timesyncd** is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an **SNTP (Simple NTP)** client. This daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with **systemd-networkd** to only operate when network connectivity is available.
        
    The modification time of the file **/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock** indicates the timestamp of the last successful synchronization (or at least the **systemd build date**, in case synchronization was not possible).
    
    **Source URL**
    * [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync)
    
    **How to use**
    <img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/Time.PNG">
    * Enable NTP by **Web-UI** `Server configuration`
      ->`Date and time settings`
    * Enable NTP by command
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp true  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**_ 
    
      If NTP is Enabled and network is Connected (Using **eth2** connect to router), we will see the item **systemd-timesyncd.service active** is **yes** and **System clock synchronized** is **yes**. Thus, system time will sync from NTP server to get current time.
    * Get NTP status  
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >Universal time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >**System clock synchronized: yes**  
      >**systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  
      
    * Disable NTP  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp false  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: no**_  
      
    * Using Local NTP server Configuration  
    When starting, systemd-timesyncd will read the configuration file from **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf**, which looks like as below: 
        >_[Time]  
        >\#NTP=  
        >\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_  
    
    	By default, systemd-timesyncd uses the Google Public NTP servers **time[1-4].google.com**, if no other NTP configuration is available. To add time servers or change the provided ones, **uncomment** the relevant line and list their host name or IP separated by a space. For example, we setup NB windows 10 system as NTP server with IP **192.168.1.128**  
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**  
    	>\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_
    
    * BMC connect to local NTP server of windows 10 system  
      Connect to NB through **eth0** EMAC interface, and set static IP **192.168.1.15**  
    
      ```
      ifconfig eth0 up
      ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.15
      ```  
      >_Note: Before that you need to setup your NTP server (192.168.1.128) on Windows 10 system first_  
      
      Modify **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf** file on BMC as we mentioned
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**_  
      
      Re-start NTP to make effect about our configuration change  
      ```
      systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
      ```  
      Check status of NTP that show already synced to our local time server 
      ```
      systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service -l --no-pager
      ```  
      >_Status: "Synchronized to time server 192.168.1.128:123 (192.168.1.128)."_  
      
      Verify **Web-UI** `Server overview`->`BMC time` whether sync from NTP server as same as **timedatectl**. (Note: timedatectl time zone default is UTC, thus you will find the BMC time is UTC+8)
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >Universal time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >System clock synchronized: yes  
      >systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  

  * **Time settings**  
    **Phosphor-time-manager** provides two objects on D-Bus
      >_/xyz/openbmc_project/time/bmc_
      >
      >_/xyz/openbmc_project/time/host_  

      **BMC time** is used by journal event log record, and **Host time** is used by Host do IPMI Set SEL Time command to sync BMC time from Host mechanism in an era of BMC without any network interface.  
      Currently, we cannot set Host time no matter what we use **busctl**, **REST API** or **ipmitool set time set** command. Due to **phosphor-settingd** this daemon set default TimeOwner is BMC and TimeSyncMethod is NTP. Thus, when TimeOwner is BMC that is not allow to set Host time anyway.

      A summary of which cases the time can be set on BMC or HOST

      Mode      | Owner | Set BMC Time  | Set Host Time
      --------- | ----- | ------------- | -------------------
      NTP       | BMC   | Fail to set   | Not allowed (Default setting)
      NTP       | HOST  | Not allowed   | Not allowed
      NTP       | SPLIT | Fail to set   | OK
      NTP       | BOTH  | Fail to set   | Not allowed
      MANUAL    | BMC   | OK            | Not allowed
      MANUAL    | HOST  | Not allowed   | OK
      MANUAL    | SPLIT | OK            | OK
      MANUAL    | BOTH  | OK            | OK

      If user would like to set Host time that need to set Owner to SPLIT in NTP mode or set Owner to HOST/SPLIT/BOTH in MANUAL mode. However, change Host time will not effect BMC time and journal event log timestamp.

    **Set Time Owner to Split**
    ```
    ### With busctl on BMC
    busctl set-property xyz.openbmc_project.Settings \
       /xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner \
       TimeOwner s xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split
    
    ### With REST API on remote host
    curl -c cjar -b cjar -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X  PUT  -d \
       '{"data": "xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split" }' \
       https://${BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner/attr/TimeOwner
    ```
    **TimeZone**  
    According OpenBMC current design that only support UTC TimeZone now, we can use below command to get current support TimeZone on BMC
    ```
    timedatectl list-timezones
    ```

### Sensor
[phosphor-hwmon](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon) daemon will periodically check the sensor reading to see if it exceeds lower bound or upper bound . If alarm condition is hit, the [phosphor-sel-logger](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-sel-logger) handles all sensor events to add new IPMI SEL records to the journal, [phosphor-host-ipmid](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-host-ipmid) will convert the journal SEL records to IPMI SEL record format and reply to host.

**How to use**

* **Configure sensor**
    
  * Add Sensor Configuration File
  
    Each sensor **temperature**, **adc**, **fan**, **peci** and **power** has a [hwmon config file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon/obmc/hwmon/ahb/apb) and [ipmi sdr config file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-sensors.yaml) that defines the sensor name and its warning or critical thresholds. These files are located under **recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon%/obmc/hwmon/apb/** and **recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-sensors.yaml**.  

    Below is hwmon config for a LM75 sensor on BMC. The sensor type is **temperature** and its name is **bmc_card**. It has warning and critical thresholds for **upper** and **lower** bound.
      ```
      LABEL_temp1 = "bmc_card"
      WARNHI_temp1 = "110000"
      WARNLO_temp1 = "5000"
      CRITHI_temp1 = "115000"
      CRITLO_temp1 = "0"
      ```
    Below is ipmi sdr config for a LM75 sensor on BMC.

### BIOS POST Code
In NPCM750, we support a FIFO for monitoring BIOS POST Code. Typically, this feature is used by the BMC to "watch" host boot progress via port 0x80 writes made by the BIOS during the boot process.

**Source URL**

This is a patch for enabling BIOS POST Code feature in [phosphor-host-postd](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-postd) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/host/phosphor-host-postd_%25.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/host/phosphor-host-postd_%25.bbappend)

**How to use**

* Execute BIOS POST Code test program by command in BMC
  ```
  snooper
  ```

  This command will trigger snooper test program to record BIOS POST Code from port 0x80 of host and save to file with timestamp filename in BMC for each host power on or reset.
  > _Saved filename format example: 2019_4_30_11_52_35_ON_

* Server Power on

  Press `Power on` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.
  During server power on, snooper test program will print received BIOS POST Code on screen and record to file in BMC at the same time.
  > _Snooper test program print received BIOS POST Code example:_
    > _recv: 0x3

### FRU
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/cab7306/openbmc/fru.png">

Field Replaceable Unit. The FRU Information is used to primarily to provide “inventory” information about the boards that the FRU Information Device is located on. In NPCM750, we connect EEPROM component as FRU Information Device to support this feature. Typically, this feature is used by the BMC to "monitor" host server health about H/W copmonents status.

**Source URL**

This is a patch for enabling FRU feature in [phosphor-impi-fru](https://github.com/openbmc/ipmi-fru-parser) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru_%25.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru_%25.bbappend)

**How to use**
* Modify DTS settings of EEPROM for FRU.
  For example about DTS **nuvoton-npcm750-evb.dts**:
  ```
  i2c4: i2c@84000 {
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <0>;
      bus-frequency = <100000>;
      status = "okay";
      eeprom@54 {
          compatible = "atmel,24c64";
          reg = <0x54>;
      };
  };
  ```

  According DTS modification, you also need to remember modify your EEPROM file description content about **SYSFS_PATH** and **FRUID**. Below is example for our EEPROM file description **[motherboard](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru/obmc/eeproms/system/chassis/motherboard)**:
  ```
  SYSFS_PATH=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0050/eeprom
  FRUID=1
  ```
  **SYSFS_PATH** is the path according your DTS setting and **FRUID** is arbitrary number but need to match **Fruid** in **[config.yaml](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-fru.yaml)** file. Below is example for when **Fruid** set as 1:
  ```
  1: #Fruid
    /system/chassis/motherboard:
      entityID: 7
      entityInstance: 1
      interfaces:
        xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.Asset:
          BuildDate:
            IPMIFruProperty: Mfg Date
            IPMIFruSection: Board
          PartNumber:
            IPMIFruProperty: Part Number
            IPMIFruSection: Board
          Manufacturer:
            IPMIFruProperty: Manufacturer
            IPMIFruSection: Board
          SerialNumber:
            IPMIFruProperty: Serial Number
            IPMIFruSection: Board
        xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item:
          PrettyName:
            IPMIFruProperty: Name
            IPMIFruSection: Board
        xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.Revision:
          Version:
            IPMIFruProperty: FRU File ID
            IPMIFruSection: Board
  ```

### Fan PID Control
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e12e9dd/openbmc/fan_stepwise_pwm.png">
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/8fc19a1/openbmc/fan_rpms.png">

In NPCM750, we have two PWM modules and support eight PWM signals to control fans for dynamic adjustment according temperature variation.

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control)
* [https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon)

**How to use**

In order to automatically apply accurate and responsive correction to a fan control function, we use the `swampd` to handle output PWM signal. For enable this daemon, basically we need configuring the swampd configuration file and deploy a system service for start this daemon as below steps.

>_NOTICE: In current solution, we only use stepwise mechanism to control fans. But the swampd also can controls fan with PID by tuning parameters according to customer platform._

* The swampd(PID control daemon) is a Margin-based daemon running within the OpenBMC environment. It uses a well-defined [configuration file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/fans/phosphor-pid-control/config-olympus-nuvoton.json) to control the temperature of the tray components to keep them within operating conditions.

    Here is a configuraion example shows how to using one PWM control more than one fans on system.

        },
    ]
    ```
    The [PID README](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/master/configure.md) provide more detail about the meaning for each parameter.

    Roughly speaking, there are two main section in configuration file: **sensor** and **zones**.
    **Sensors** defined the all component which are involved PID like temperature sensors, or fans.
    **Zones** defined the mechanism how the swampd control each fans by setting parameters.

    The most important in **sensors** section is the settings of `readPath` and `writePath`.
    Sensors like temperature sensor or margin sensor must only set readPath, and fill up empty string to writePath.
    Fans could set the D-Bus path to readPath, also set the pwm system path to writePath.
    More detail about readPath and writePath please refer README that mentioned above.

    There are four PID controller types user can use: `fan`, `temp`, `margin`, and `stepwise` in **zones**.
    User can tune the PID parameters following the [tuning README](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/master/tuning.md). 

    In above example case, the fan PID controller has a lot of PID parameters. And we only use the stepwise controller to control whole zone, so the PID parameters in fan controller like `integralCoeff` or `outLim_max` would not work.
    And the parameter `inputs` for stepwise controller must be thermal sensor.
    Please note the parameter `setpoint` is no meaning for type `fan` and `stepwise` currently, and cannot be left out.

    If user want to control whole zone by stepwise controller like example configuration, the key point is set reading and output.
    The `stepwise` PID use the mapping of reading and output value instead of set RPM setpoint.
    The reading and output value should be a pair, and user can set 20 pairs in maximum, one more pairs at least.
    And the `stepwise` will return output setpoint if temperature **is larger** than reading value.
    For example, assume here are pairs of `stepwise` reading and output:
    ```
    {
      "reading": {25, 26, 27},
      "output": {10, 20, 30}
    }
    ```

    If the temperature reading is 25.5°C, the return value will be 10.
    And if the reading value is 26.5°C, the stepwise controller will set 20% RPM to fan(s).


* OpenBMC will run swampd through [phosphor-pid-control.service](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/fans/phosphor-pid-control/phosphor-pid-control.service) that controls the fans by pre-defined zones. Here is a example service.
    ```
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/swampd
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5
    StartLimitInterval=0
    ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/fan-default-speed.sh
    ```
    + **ExecStopPost** that means an additional commands that are executed after the service is stopped.

## IPMI / DCMI

### SOL IPMI
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/8afa8a2/openbmc/sol_ipmi_win10.PNG">

The Serial over LAN (SoL) via IPMI redirects the output of the server’s serial port to a command/terminal window on your workstation.

The user uses the ipmi tool like [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) to interact with SOL via IPMI. Here the ipmiutil is used as an example.

## JTAG Master
JTAG master is implemented on BMC to facilitate debugging host CPU or programming CPLD device.  

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Intel-BMC/asd](https://github.com/Intel-BMC/asd)
* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-util/tree/master/loadsvf](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-util/tree/master/loadsvf)

### ASD
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/870d09e/openbmc/asd.png">
The Intel® At-Scale Debug feature allows for using any host system to run the Debug tool stack while connecting to the target system across the network. The target system must have a BMC which has physical connectivity to the JTAG pins as a minimum requirement of functionality.    

**How to use**

Here uses the RunBMC Olympus server as example.

1. switch JPC1 jumper on host to 2-3.
2. configure GPIO40(BMC_XDP_JTAG_SEL_N) to connect BMC JTAG to Host CPU
    ```
    echo 40 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio40/value
    ```
3. configure BMC_TCK_MUX_SEL pin to CPU TCK
    ```
    echo 22 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value
    ```
4. Run ASD daemon on BMC
    ```
    asd -u -n eth1 --log-level=warning -p 5123
    ```
5. Launch CScripts on debug host
    ```
    Assume CScripts source folder = $CS, OpenIPC source folder = $OIPC
    Edit $OIPC/openipc/Config/SKX/SKX_ASD_RC-Pins.xml
    - Change ip address to BMC ip address
    Edit $OIPC/openipc/Config/OpenIpcConfig.xml
    - Change DefaultIpcConfig tag as <DefaultIpcConfig Name="SKX_ASD_RC-Pins"/>
    export IPC_PATH=$OIPC/openipc/Bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$IPC_PATH
    Go to $CS/cscripts, execute "python startCscripts.py -a ipc"
    ```
6. Execute OpenIPC idcode operation in CScripts command prompt. It will show the TAP device's idcode.
    ```
    >>> import ipccli
    >>> ipc = ipccli.baseaccess()
    >>> ipc.idcode(0)
    ```


### CPLD Programming
The motherboard on server have a CPLD device that can be upgraded firmware on it. BMC can load svf file to program CPLD via JTAG.  

**How to use**

run loadsvf on Runbmc to program CPLD. Specify the svf file name with -s.
```
loadsvf -d /dev/jtag0 -s firmware.svf
```

## In-Band Firmware Update
This is a secure flash update mechanism to update HOST/BMC firmware via LPC/PCI.

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-phosphor/nuvoton-layer/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-flash_%25.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-phosphor/nuvoton-layer/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-flash_%25.bbappend)

### HOST Tool
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/322d0d3/openbmc/in-band-fu.png">

The host-tool depends on `ipmi-blob-tool` and `pciutils`.

#### Building pciutils
Check out the [pciutils source](https://github.com/pciutils/pciutils).

Then run these commands in the source directory.
```
make SHARED=yes
make SHARED=yes install
make install-lib
```

#### Building ipmi-blob-tool
Check out the [ipmi-blob-tool source](https://github.com/openbmc/ipmi-blob-tool).
Then run these commands in the source directory.

```
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
make install
```

#### Building burn_my_bmc (the host-tool)
Check out the [phosphor-ipmi-flash source](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-ipmi-flash).
Then run these commands in the source directory.
If you choose "enable-nuvoton-p2a-vga", then the tool will support LPC and PCI-VGA.
If you choose "enable-nuvoton-p2a-mbox", then the tool will support LPC and PCI-MailBox

```
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --disable-build-bmc-blob-handler --enable-nuvoton-p2a-vga
make
make install
```

**How to use**
1. If you want to do firmware update over LPC, then you need to check the memory address which BIOS allocates for LPC.
You could use "ioport" tool and following commands to get the address.
    ```
    sudo outb 0x4e 0x07
    sudo outb 0x4f 0x0f

    # Host address a7-a0
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF4
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # Host address a15-a8
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF5
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # Host address a23-a16
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF6
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # Host address a32-a24
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF7
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # shm active?
    sudo outb 0x4e 0x30
    sudo inb 0x4f

    ```

2. Here is an example for upadting over LPC, and --length is fixed.
    ```
    sudo ./burn_my_bmc --command update --interface ipmilpc --image image-bmc --sig image-bmc.sig --type image --address 0x817e0000 --length 0x1000
    ```

3. Here is an example for upadting over PCI(both VGA and MailBox)and --type is fixed
    ```
    sudo ./burn_my_bmc --command update --interface ipmipci --image image-bmc --sig image-bmc.sig --type image
    ```

### IPMI Library
This is an OpenBMC IPMI Library (Handler) for In-Band Firmware Update.

**How to use**
1. You need to enable the way you want to transfer data from host to BMC
    ```
    nuvoton-lpc
    enable-nuvoton-p2a-mbox
    enable-nuvoton-p2a-vga
    ```

2. select the corresponding address for IPMI_FLASH_BMC_ADDRESS_nuvoton
    ```
    0x7F400000
    0xF0848000
    0xc0008000
    ```
