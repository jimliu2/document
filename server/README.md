### BMC Firmware Update Over Lan
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/cab7306/openbmc/firmware-update.png">

This is a secure flash update mechanism to update BMC firmware via WebUI.

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt)

**How to use**

* Update firmware via WebUI
    1. Upload update package from web UI, then you will see
        ```
        Activate
        ```
        > If you select activate, then you will see activation dialog at item 2

        ```
        Delete
        ```
        > If you select delete, then the package will be deleted right now

    2. Confirm BMC firmware file activation
        ```
        ACTIVATE FIRMWARE FILE WITHOUT REBOOTING BMC
        ```
        > If you select this, you need to reboot BMC manually, and shutdown application will run update script to flash image into SPI flash

        ```
        ACTIVATE FIRMWARE FILE AND AUTOMATICALLY REBOOT BMC
        ```
        > if you select this, BMC will shutdown right now, and shutdown application will run update script to flash image into SPI flash

* Update firmware via Redfish

    We can update BMC firmware via REST API provided by Redfish. The firmware will apply immediately after uploaded without any confirmation by default.
    The following command shows how to using curl command upload BMC firmware.
    ```
    curl -k -H "X-Auth-Token: $token" -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" -X POST -T obmc-phosphor-image-olympus-nuvoton.static.mtd.tar https://${BMC_IP}/redfish/v1/UpdateService

### BIOS Firmware Update Over Lan
<img align="right" width="40%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/0771b2f/openbmc/bios_update_demo.PNG">
  This BIOS update function is implemented according to Openbmc firmware update mechanism. Users can update BIOS just like they update BMC firmware via web UI.


**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt)
* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-olympus-nuvoton/ipmi-bios-update](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-olympus-nuvoton/ipmi-bios-update)

**How to use**

* Prepare the BIOS image for update

  1. MANIFEST

      The manifest for BIOS must set *purpose=xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Version.VersionPurpose.Host*, and provide version information.
      Others information just set as BMC manifest.
      ```
      purpose=xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Version.VersionPurpose.Host
      version=F0B_1B01.07
      KeyType=OpenBMC
      HashType=RSA-SHA256
      ```

  2. BIOS firmware

      rename BIOS image to image-bios
      ```
      mv BIOS image-bios
      ```

  3. public key

      Prepare your own key pair for sign BIOS firmware, and put the public key in image. Then sign the image-bios as following command:
      ```
      openssl dgst -sha256 -sign userkey.priv -out image-bios.sig image-bios
      ```
  4. Sign MANIFEST and public key

      Follow the BMC update signature verify flow, we also need sign MANIFEST and user public key by BMC system key.
      ```
      openssl dgst -sha256 -sign OpenBMC.priv -out MANIFEST.sig MANIFEST
      openssl dgst -sha256 -sign OpenBMC.priv -out publickey.sig publickey
      ```

  5. Collect data and tar image

      Now we have six files, and we just need tar them to a file.
      ```
      tar -cf image-bios.tar image-bios image-bios.sig MANIFEST MANIFEST.sig publickey publickey.sig
      ```

* Update BIOS

  There are two way updating BIOS image just like BMC firmware update.

  1. WebUI

      Upload tar image, and active it.
      ```
      Server configuration
       -> Firmware
         -> Choose file (select image-bios.tar)
         -> Click "Upload firmware" button
         -> Click "Active" link
             -> Select "ACTIVATE FIRMWARE FILE AND AUTOMATICALLY REBOOT SERVER"
             -> Click Continue
      ```

  2. Redfish

      We can update BIOS image via REST API just like BMC firmware. And the image will apply immediately after uploaded by default.
      ```
      curl -k -H "X-Auth-Token: $token" -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" -X POST -T image-bios.tar https://${BMC_IP}/redfish/v1/UpdateService
      ```
      >_${token} is the token value come from login API, read more information from [REST README](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/REST-cheatsheet.md)_

### Server Power Operations
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/8fc19a1/openbmc/power_ops.png">

Server Power Operations are using to Power on/Warm reboot/Cold reboot/Orderly shutdown/Immediate shutdown remote host PC.

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/chassis](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/chassis)

**How to use**

1. Configure reaction of power button on generic host OS
    * When host OS is running **Linux** and you press **PWRON** button on motherboard, you're prompted with a list of options - this is the **interactive** shutdown. The OS will go **Orderly shutdown** for a while if you didn't select any action from it. If you don't want this interactive shutdown pop up and hope OS go **Orderly shutdown** directly, you can enter below command in terminal before testing:
      ```
      gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power 'shutdown'
      ```
    * When host OS is running **Windows** and you press **PWRON** button on motherboard, the default reaction is **Orderly shutdown**. Thus, you didn't need to configure reaction of power button in Windows. But, if you find the default reaction is not **Orderly shutdown**, please check `Control Panel`->`Power Options`->`System Settings` in Windows OS.

    * About Watchdog patch

      There is a package **phosphor-watchdog** included in OpenBMC now. The watchdog daemon is started on host's power on, which is used to monitor if host is alive. In normal case, when host starts, it will send IPMI commands to kick watchdog and so everything would work fine. If host fails to start, the watchdog eventually timeout. However, the default watchdog timeout action is **HardReset** which is defined at [Watchdog.interface.yaml](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/xyz/openbmc_project/State/Watchdog.interface.yaml) in **phosphor-dbus-interfaces** that will cause host rebooted after power on.

2. Configure GPIO pin definitions for **POWER_SW**, **RESET_SW** and **PGOOD** on BMC

    * Pin **POWER_SW** (GPIO451) is use to do all server power operations, pin **RESET_SW** (GPIO452) is reserve for reset operations, and **PGOOD** (GPIO506) is use to monitor DC real status that indicate `Server power` in WebUI.

    * If other GPIO pins are preferred, please modify the file [gpio_defs.json](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/skeleton/obmc-libobmc-intf/gpio_defs.json).

    * Content below is a part of **gpio_defs.json** for this sample:
      ```
      "power_config": {
          "power_good_in": "PGOOD",
          "power_up_outs": [
              {"name": "POWER_UP_PIN", "polarity": false},
              {"name": "POWER_UP_PIN", "polarity": true}
          ]
      }

      "name": "PGOOD",
      "num": 506,
      "direction": "in"

      "name": "POWER_UP_PIN",
      "num": 451,
      "direction": "out"

      "name": "RESET_UP_PIN",
      "num": 452,
      "direction": "out"
      ```
      > _"name" here is referred in code and fixed, please don't modify it. "num"  means GPIO pin number and changeable here, "direction" should be set as "in" for **PGOOD**, "out" for **RESET_UP_PIN** and **POWER_UP_PIN**, and "polarity" should be set as "false" then set as "true" for **POWER_UP_PIN** accordind NPCM750 schematic._

3. Server Power on
    * Press `Power on` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _[obmc-host-start@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/blob/master/target_files/obmc-host-start%40.target) is the one driving the boot of the system._

4. Server Power off (Soft)
    * Press `Orderly shutdown` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _The soft server power off function is encapsulated in the [obmc-host-shutdown@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/blob/master/target_files/obmc-host-shutdown%40.target) that is soft in that it notifies the host of the power off request and gives it a certain amount of time to shut itself down._

5. Server Power off (Hard)
    * Press `Immediate shutdown` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _The hard server power off is encapsulated in the [obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/blob/master/target_files/obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff%40.target) that will force the stopping of the soft power off service if running, and immediately cut power to the system._

6. Server Reboot (Warm)
    * Press `Warm reboot` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _The warm reboot of the server is encapsulated in the [obmc-host-reboot@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/blob/master/target_files/obmc-host-reboot%40.target) that will utilize the server power off (soft) target [obmc-host-shutdown@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/blob/master/target_files/obmc-host-shutdown%40.target) and then, once that completes, start the host power on target [obmc-host-start@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/blob/master/target_files/obmc-host-start%40.target)._

7. Server Reboot (Cold)
    * Press `Cold reboot` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.

      > _The cold reboot of the server is shutdown server immediately, then restarts it. This target will utilize the Immediate shutdown target [obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/blob/master/target_files/obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff%40.target) and then, start the host power on target [obmc-host-start@.target](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/blob/master/target_files/obmc-host-start%40.target)._

### Certificate Management
<img align="right" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/ssl_certificate.png">  

Manage the certificates installed on BMC.  
* Web Server certificate
* LDAP Client certificate
* CA certificate  

Management operations:
* Install a new certificate.  
* Replace an existing certificate. 
* Delete an existing certificate. 

**Source URL**
* [https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-certificate-manager](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-certificate-manager)

**How to use**  
1. Web server certificate  
   * Web server certificate is used to initiate a SSL session with browsers.
   * bmcweb will generate a self-signed certificate if no server certificate exists.
   * certificate file path
     > /etc/ssl/certs/https/server.pem
   * replace certificate with new one.
     * generate a new self-signed certificate using openssl. 
     ```
     openssl req -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048  -nodes -days 365  -keyout cert.pem -out cert.pem  -subj "/O=XYZ Corporation /CN=www.xyz.com"
     ```
     * replace certificate by the new cert "cert.pem" via WebUI.  
       <img align="top" width="70%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/replace_cert.png">
     * restart bmcweb service on BMC.  
       > systemctl restart bmcweb  
       
     * connect to BMC web server and check the web certificate issuer from browser, it should be "www.xyz.com".      
       <img align="top" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/new_certificate.png">
2. CA certificate
   * if server authentication is required in a TLS session, LDAP client will use CA certificate (issuer of server certificate) to verify server's identity when initiating a TLS session.
   * refer to [LDAP server setup](#ldap-server-setup) to generate a CA certificate and configure LDAP server.
     * Note: CN in LDAP server certificate must match server's URI (i.e. IP address or hostname).
       ```
       #example ssl command to generate server certificate

   * install CA certificate onto BMC via WebUI

3. LDAP client certificate
   * if client authentication is required in a TLS session, LDAP server will use CA certificate (issuer of client certificate) to verify client's identity when initiating a TLS session. BMC needs to install a client certificate signed with CA certificate.
   * generate a client certificate with signature signed with CA certificate.
     ```
     openssl genrsa -out ldap_client.key 2048
     openssl req -new -key ldap_client.key -out ldap_client.csr -subj '/C=TW/ST=Taiwan/L=Tainan/O=Nuvoton Ltd/OU=CS20/CN=ldap client'
     openssl x509 -req -days 365 -CA ca_cert.pem -CAkey ca_key.pem -CAcreateserial -CAserial serial -in ldap_client.csr -out ldap_client.cert
     ```
   * Because the LDAP certificate installed on BMC also requires a private key, combine ssl certificate and private key into one pem file
     ```
     cat ldap_client.key ldap_client.cert > ldap_client.pem
     ```
   * install ldap_client.pem onto BMC via WebUI
4. Enable LDAP over SSL  
   * The enable action on WebUI will enable LDAP client to perform server authentication when initiating a TLS session.    
      <img align="top" width="70%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/enable_ldap_over_ssl.png">
    * To enable client authentication, add following config to ldap server configuration file (slapd.conf in this case).  
      > TLSVerifyClient demand
    
5. Test LDAP server.
   * Log in BMC WebUI using user1/123

## System

### Sensors
[phosphor-hwmon](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon) daemon will periodically check the sensor reading to see if it exceeds lower bound or upper bound . If alarm condition is hit, the [phosphor-sel-logger](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-sel-logger) handles all sensor events to add new IPMI SEL records to the journal, [phosphor-host-ipmid](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-host-ipmid) will convert the journal SEL records to IPMI SEL record format and reply to host.

**How to use**

* **Configure sensor**
    
  * Add Sensor Configuration File
  
    Each sensor **temperature**, **adc**, **fan**, **peci** and **power** has a [hwmon config file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon/obmc/hwmon/ahb/apb) and [ipmi sdr config file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-sensors.yaml) that defines the sensor name and its warning or critical thresholds. These files are located under **recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon%/obmc/hwmon/apb/** and **recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-sensors.yaml**.  

    Below is hwmon config for a LM75 sensor on BMC. The sensor type is **temperature** and its name is **bmc_card**. It has warning and critical thresholds for **upper** and **lower** bound.
      ```
      LABEL_temp1 = "bmc_card"
      WARNHI_temp1 = "110000"
      WARNLO_temp1 = "5000"

### Fan PID Control
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e12e9dd/openbmc/fan_stepwise_pwm.png">
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/8fc19a1/openbmc/fan_rpms.png">

In NPCM750, we have two PWM modules and support eight PWM signals to control fans for dynamic adjustment according temperature variation.

**Source URL**

**How to use**

In order to automatically apply accurate and responsive correction to a fan control function, we use the `swampd` to handle output PWM signal. For enable this daemon, basically we need configuring the swampd configuration file and deploy a system service for start this daemon as below steps.

>_NOTICE: In current solution, we only use stepwise mechanism to control fans. But the swampd also can controls fan with PID by tuning parameters according to customer platform._

* The swampd(PID control daemon) is a Margin-based daemon running within the OpenBMC environment. It uses a well-defined [configuration file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/fans/phosphor-pid-control/config-olympus-nuvoton.json) to control the temperature of the tray components to keep them within operating conditions.

    Here is a configuraion example shows how to using one PWM control more than one fans on system.

    ]
    ```
    The [PID README](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/master/configure.md) provide more detail about the meaning for each parameter.

    Roughly speaking, there are two main section in configuration file: **sensor** and **zones**.
    **Sensors** defined the all component which are involved PID like temperature sensors, or fans.
    **Zones** defined the mechanism how the swampd control each fans by setting parameters.

    The most important in **sensors** section is the settings of `readPath` and `writePath`.
    Sensors like temperature sensor or margin sensor must only set readPath, and fill up empty string to writePath.
    Fans could set the D-Bus path to readPath, also set the pwm system path to writePath.
    More detail about readPath and writePath please refer README that mentioned above.

    There are four PID controller types user can use: `fan`, `temp`, `margin`, and `stepwise` in **zones**.
    User can tune the PID parameters following the [tuning README](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/master/tuning.md). 

    In above example case, the fan PID controller has a lot of PID parameters. And we only use the stepwise controller to control whole zone, so the PID parameters in fan controller like `integralCoeff` or `outLim_max` would not work.
    And the parameter `inputs` for stepwise controller must be thermal sensor.
    Please note the parameter `setpoint` is no meaning for type `fan` and `stepwise` currently, and cannot be left out.

    If user want to control whole zone by stepwise controller like example configuration, the key point is set reading and output.
    The `stepwise` PID use the mapping of reading and output value instead of set RPM setpoint.
    The reading and output value should be a pair, and user can set 20 pairs in maximum, one more pairs at least.
    And the `stepwise` will return output setpoint if temperature **is larger** than reading value.
    For example, assume here are pairs of `stepwise` reading and output:
    ```
    {
      "reading": {25, 26, 27},
      "output": {10, 20, 30}
    }
    ```

    If the temperature reading is 25.5°C, the return value will be 10.
    And if the reading value is 26.5°C, the stepwise controller will set 20% RPM to fan(s).


* OpenBMC will run swampd through [phosphor-pid-control.service](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/fans/phosphor-pid-control/phosphor-pid-control.service) that controls the fans by pre-defined zones. Here is a example service.

### Event Policy

phosphor-dbus-monitor service can watch on specific dbus objects/properties and perform predefined event callbacks when the property state has changed or meets the condition defined in config file.  

**Source URL**
* [phosphor-dbus-monitor](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-monitor)
* [phosphor-snmp](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-snmp)

**Event Callbacks**

The event callbacks can be the following actions. Logging to journal or elog, calling d-bus methods, or sending snmp traps. Here is an example that log to journal and send d-bus message to shutdown host when the specific temperature sensor reaches the critical high threshold.

* [Example config](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-runbmc-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/configuration/runbmc-nuvoton-yaml-config/runbmc-nuvoton-dbus-monitor-config.yaml)

**SNMP trap**

**How to use** 
1. Install snmp trap receiver on the management server. Refer to the [link](https://blog.cadena-it.com/linux-tips-how-to/snmp-trap-receiver-with-ubuntu/) for the installation.
    * Copy [BMC notification MIB](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-snmp/blob/master/mibs/NotificationMIB.txt) to `/usr/share/snmp/mibs`.
    * Run snmptrapd with -m option to load custom MIB
    ```
    snmptrapd -m OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB -Lf /var/log/snmptrap.log -f
    ```
2. Specify snmp manager ip/port in Openbmc WebUI
   ```
    Server configuration
     -> SNMP settings
       -> Add Managers
          -> enter the snmp manger ip and port(default is 162)
    ```
3. Check snmp trap log in snmp manager.
   * /var/log/snmptrap.log
   * the OIDs in log file will be translated to human readable string defined in MIB
   * Example:
   ```
   TRAP2, SNMP v2c, community publicDU Attribute/Value Pair Array:
   SNMPv2-SMI::snmpModules.1.1.4.1.0 = OID: OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorNotification
   OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorID = Gauge32: 135
   OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorTimestamp = Opaque: UInt64: 780329535445925888
   OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorSeverity = INTEGER: 3
   OPENBMC-NOTIFICATION-MIB::obmcErrorMessage = STRING:   "xyz.openbmc_project.Sensor.Threshold.Error.WarningLow"

### Time Sync
  We provided three ways that user can synchronize the BMC time from network or host.

### NTP Server
  Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.

  **systemd-timesyncd** is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an **SNTP (Simple NTP)** client. This daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with **systemd-networkd** to only operate when network connectivity is available.
        
  The modification time of the file **/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock** indicates the timestamp of the last successful synchronization (or at least the **systemd build date**, in case synchronization was not possible).
    
  **Source URL**
  * [https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-time-manager](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-time-manager)
  * [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync)
    
  **How to use**
  <img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/Time.PNG">
  * Enable NTP by **Web-UI** `Server configuration`
      ->`Date and time settings`
  * Enable NTP by command
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp true  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**_ 
    
      If NTP is Enabled and network is Connected (Using **eth1** connect to router), we will see the item **systemd-timesyncd.service active** is **yes** and **System clock synchronized** is **yes**. Thus, system time will sync from NTP server to get current time.
  * Get NTP status  
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >Universal time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >**System clock synchronized: yes**  
      >**systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  
      
  * Disable NTP  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp false  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: no**_  
      
  * Using Local NTP server Configuration  
    When starting, systemd-timesyncd will read the configuration file from **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf**, which looks like as below: 
        >_[Time]  
        >\#NTP=  
        >\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_  
    
    	By default, systemd-timesyncd uses the Google Public NTP servers **time[1-4].google.com**, if no other NTP configuration is available. To add time servers or change the provided ones, **uncomment** the relevant line and list their host name or IP separated by a space. For example, we setup NB windows 10 system as NTP server with IP **192.168.1.128**  
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**  
    	>\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_
    
  * BMC connect to local NTP server of windows 10 system  
      Connect to NB through **eth1** EMAC interface, and set static IP **192.168.1.15**  
    
      ```
      ifconfig eth1 up
      ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.15
      ```  
      >_Note: Before that you need to setup your NTP server (192.168.1.128) on Windows 10 system first_  
      
      Modify **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf** file on BMC as we mentioned
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**_  
      
      Re-start NTP to make effect about our configuration change  
      ```
      systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
      ```  
      Check status of NTP that show already synced to our local time server 
      ```
      systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service -l --no-pager
      ```  
      >_Status: "Synchronized to time server 192.168.1.128:123 (192.168.1.128)."_  
      
      Verify **Web-UI** `Server overview`->`BMC time` whether sync from NTP server as same as **timedatectl**. (Note: timedatectl time zone default is UTC, thus you will find the BMC time is UTC+8)
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >Universal time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >System clock synchronized: yes  
      >systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_

  * TimeZone  
      According OpenBMC current design that only support UTC TimeZone now, we can use below command to get current support TimeZone on BMC
      ```
      timedatectl list-timezones
      ```

### Inventory

### IPMI FRU
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/cab7306/openbmc/fru.png">

Field Replaceable Unit. The FRU Information is used to primarily to provide “inventory” information about the boards that the FRU Information Device is located on. In NPCM750, we connect EEPROM component as FRU Information Device to support this feature. Typically, this feature is used by the BMC to "monitor" host server health about H/W copmonents status.

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru_%25.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru_%25.bbappend)

**How to use**
* Check DTS settings of EEPROM for FRU.
  For example about DTS **nuvoton-npcm750-runbmc-olympus.dts**:
  ```
  i2c4: i2c@84000 {
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <0>;
      bus-frequency = <100000>;
      status = "okay";
      eeprom@54 {
          compatible = "atmel,24c64";
          reg = <0x54>;
      };
  };
  ```

  According DTS modification, you also need to remember modify your EEPROM file description content about **SYSFS_PATH** and **FRUID**. Below is example for our EEPROM file description **[motherboard](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru/obmc/eeproms/system/chassis/motherboard)**:
  ```
  SYSFS_PATH=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/4-0054/eeprom
  FRUID=1
  ```
  **SYSFS_PATH** is the path according your DTS setting and **FRUID** is arbitrary number but need to match **Fruid** in **[config.yaml](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-fru.yaml)** file. Below is example for when **Fruid** set as 1:
  ```
  1: #Fruid
    /system/chassis/motherboard:
      entityID: 7
      entityInstance: 1
      interfaces:
        xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.Asset:
          BuildDate:
            IPMIFruProperty: Mfg Date
            IPMIFruSection: Board
          PartNumber:
            IPMIFruProperty: Part Number
            IPMIFruSection: Board
          Manufacturer:
            IPMIFruProperty: Manufacturer
            IPMIFruSection: Board
          SerialNumber:
            IPMIFruProperty: Serial Number
            IPMIFruSection: Board
        xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item:
          PrettyName:
            IPMIFruProperty: Name
            IPMIFruSection: Board
        xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.Revision:
          Version:
            IPMIFruProperty: FRU File ID
            IPMIFruSection: Board
  ```

* Server health

  Select `Server health` -> `Hardware status` on **Web-UI** will show FRU Board Info/Chassis Info/Product Info area.

### SMBIOS
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/c240503/openbmc/smbios.png">

SMBIOS stands for System Management BIOS while DMI stands for Desktop Management Interface. Both standards are tightly related and developed by the DMTF. The BIOS should provide support according to SMBIOS Reference Specification.

In Nuvoton RunBMC Olympus, the raw DMI table are presented as binary attributes at `/sys/firmware/dmi/tables/DMI`. The format of DMI structures can be read in SMBIOS specification.

This source code is implemented SMBIOS MDR version 2 service [Intel-BMC/mdrv2](https://github.com/Intel-BMC/mdrv2) for Intel based platform that gets SMBIOS binary file `/var/lib/smbios/smbios2` in Nuvoton RunBMC then parses SMBIOS table to update BIOS/CPU/DIMM informations through xyz.openbmc_project.Smbios.MDR_V2 dbus interface.

**How to use**

* Execute `xfer_mbox_mem host` tool in Nuvoton RunBMC Olympus side

  This is a host tool [Nuvoton-BMC/xfer_mbox_mem](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-util/tree/master/xfer_mbox_mem) which is used to get SMBIOS table from host, it will copy SMBIOS table to mailbox shared memory for BMC to parse SMBIOS table. The tool usage you can refer to [xfer_mbox_mem](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-util/blob/master/xfer_mbox_mem/README.md).

* Refresh `WebUI`

  After service started, you can see the new items `BIOS`, `CPU` and `DIMM` in `WebUI`->`Health`->`Hardware status` page.  
  And you can get `CPU` and `DIMM` from /redfish/v1/Systems/system/Processors/ and /redfish/v1/Systems/system/Memory.

### Network

### VLAN

VLAN (Virtual Local Area Networks) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). VLANs work by applying tags to network frames and handling these tags in networking systems – creating the appearance and functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network but acts as if it is split between separate networks.

VLANs allow network administrators to group hosts together even if the hosts are not directly connected to the same network switch. Because VLAN membership can be configured through software, this can greatly simplify network design and deployment.

To subdivide a network into VLANs, one configures network equipment. Simpler equipment can partition only per physical port (if at all), in which case each VLAN is connected with a dedicated network cable. More sophisticated devices can mark frames through VLAN tagging, so that a single interconnect (trunk) may be used to transport data for multiple VLANs.

For more information, please refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN).

For users who prefer ipmi network utilization via VLAN, please refer to the following section **How to use**.

**How to use**

1. Configure VLAN setting of the Olympus platform by inputting the following commands on the Olympus debug console. Please replace the IP addresses mentioned below according to your configuration.
    ```
    ip link add link eth1 name eth1.1 type vlan id 1
    ip addr add 192.168.1.4/24 dev eth1.1
    ip link set up eth1.1
    ```
    If the user prefers the REST method via a remote PC, the commands are provided below as an example.
    ```
    export bmc=192.168.0.3
    export token=`curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://${bmc}/login -d '{"username" :  "root", "password" :  "0penBmc"}' | grep token | awk '{print $2;}' | tr -d '"'`
    curl -k -H "X-Auth-Token: $token" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"data":["eth1",1] }' https://${bmc}/xyz/openbmc_project/network/action/VLAN
    curl -k -H "X-Auth-Token: $token" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"data": ["xyz.openbmc_project.Network.IP.Protocol.IPv4", "192.168.1.4",24,"192.168.1.1"] }' https://${bmc}/xyz/openbmc_project/network/eth1_1/action/IP
    ```

    The expected response is listed below as an example.
    ```
    {
      "data": "/xyz/openbmc_project/network/eth1_1/ipv4/a3f185f1",
      "message": "200 OK",
      "status": "ok"
    }
    ```

    For more information, please refer to [https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-networkd/blob/master/docs/Network-Configuration.md](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-networkd/blob/master/docs/Network-Configuration.md).

2. Prepare a PC which runs Ubuntu (for example) or any OS which supports VLAN. The Olympus device and the PC are connected to an unmanaged network switch.  

   Please input the following commands in a opened terminal emulator with a privileged user account to configure the VLAN setting of the Ubuntu PC.  

   Here the network interface enp24s0f3 of the Ubuntu PC is used as an example. 
    ```
    sudo modprobe 8021q
    sudo ip link add link enp24s0f3 enp24s.1 type vlan id 1
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.5/24 dev enp24s.1
    sudo ip link set up enp24s.1
    ```

3. Ping either from Olympus or the PC to the other device.

**How to use**

* Execute BIOS POST Code test program by command in BMC
  ```
  snooper
  ```

  This command will trigger snooper test program to record BIOS POST Code from port 0x80 of host and save to file with timestamp filename in BMC for each host power on or reset.
  > _Saved filename format example: 2019_4_30_11_52_35_ON_

* Server Power on

  Press `Power on` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.
  During server power on, snooper test program will print received BIOS POST Code on screen and record to file in BMC at the same time.
  > _Snooper test program print received BIOS POST Code example:_
    > _recv: 0x3
        recv: 0x2
        recv: 0x7_

**phosphor-post-code-manager**

* This daemon [phosphor-post-code-manager](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-post-code-manager) will monitors post code posted on dbus interface /xyz/openbmc_project/state/boot/raw by snoopd daemon [phosphor-host-postd](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-postd).

* Every cycle post codes are saved as file in **/var/lib/phosphor-post-code-manager** on BMC.
  ```
  "1" file is saved all post codes for cycle 1
  "2" file is saved all post codes for cycle 2
  "CurrentBootCycleIndex" file is saved the current boot cycle number
  "CurrentBootCycleCount" file is saved the current boot cycle count
  ```

* GetPostCodes

  Method to get the cached post codes of the indicated boot cycle.
  Return an array of post codes of one boot cycle.  
  Get boot cycle 1 post codes by busctl:
  > _busctl call xyz.openbmc_project.State.Boot.PostCode /xyz/openbmc_project/State/Boot/PostCode xyz.openbmc_project.State.Boot.PostCode GetPostCodes q 1_

* GetPostCodesWithTimeStamp

### IPMI SOL
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/8afa8a2/openbmc/sol_ipmi_win10.PNG">

The Serial over LAN (SoL) via IPMI redirects the output of the server’s serial port to a command/terminal window on your workstation.

The user uses the ipmi tool like [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) to interact with SOL via IPMI. Here the ipmiutil is used as an example.

The patch integrates [phosphor-net-ipmid](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-net_%25.bbappend) into Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution for OpenBMC.

**How to use**

1. Download the [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) according to the host OS in your workstation.

   > _Here it's assumed that the host OS is Windows 10 and ipmiutil for Windows is downloaded and used accordingly._

2. Run SOL:

    * Extract or install the ipmiutil package to a folder in your workstation in advance.
    * Launch a command window and navigate to that folder.
    * Input the following command in the command window.
      ```
      ipmiutil sol -N 192.168.0.2 -U root -P 0penBmc -J 3 -V 4 -a
      ```
    * (Optional) Configure the `Properties` of the command window to see the entire output of SOL.

### Host Power Budget Control

Host Power Budget Control provides a mechanism for implement IPMI DCMI messages by using D-Bus and IPMB.

Please refer to [IPMI Website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/servers/ipmi/ipmi-home.html) for details about Message Bridging.

<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/dfdfd04/openbmc/message_bridge.png">

IPMI daemon would set or get D-Bus property to/from path like: `/xyz/openbmc_project/control/host0/power_cap` when get DCMI command from IPMI tool via network or LPC.
[Phosphor-node-manager-proxy](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-node-manager-proxy) will handle the property change and present the property value.
Once the **phosphor-node-manager-proxy** property changed, it will prepare IPMB package data and call D-Bus method "sendRequest" to D-Bus path: `/xyz/openbmc_project/Ipmi/Channel/Ipmb`.
Finally, IPMB gets the request and constructs I2C command from the request, then sends the I2C command to ME(Intel Management Engine) for getting information which controlled by ME.

The patch integrates the [ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid), [phosphor-node-manager-proxy](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-node-manager-proxy) and [ipmbbridge](https://github.com/openbmc/ipmbbridge) projects.

**How to use**

1. Configure [ipmb-channel.json](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-ipmb/ipmb-olympus-channels.json) as below sample. Check schematic to fill up BMC and ME I2C address, and each sys path.
    ```
    "channels": [
      {
        "type": "me",
        "master-path": "/dev/i2c-5",
        "slave-path": "/dev/ipmb-5",
        "bmc-addr": 32,
        "remote-addr": 44
      }
    ]
    ```

2. Deploy **phosphor-node-manager-proxy** from Intel-BMC project [node-manager](https://github.com/Intel-BMC/node-manager), because the package still not merge in OpenBMC project. And modify the interface define if need. There are few patches [Patch](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-node-manager-proxy) for node manager that makes bmcweb can get the sensor value.

3. Test power budget control.

    * Send DCMI commnad via LPC
      ```
      sudo ipmitool dcmi get_mc_id_string
      ```

      This command would return result as below:

      ```
        Get Management Controller Indentifier String: olympus-nuvoton
      ```

    * Send DCMI command via network
      ```
      sudo ipmitool -I lanplus -H 10.103.152.12 -U root -P 0penBmc dcmi power get_limit
      ```

      The result will show like below if everything is OK.

      ```
      Current Limit State: Power Limit Active
      Exception actions:   Hard Power Off & Log Event to SEL
      Power Limit:         500 Watts
      Correction time:     0 milliseconds
      Sampling period:     0 seconds
      ```

### PECI

#### Intel Crash Dump
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/5f39468/openbmc/crashdump.png">

The Intel Crash Dump feature facilitates debug of an IERR triggered and leverages uncore hardware features accessible via the PECI interface to provide a scheme to dump the Caching agent (Cbo) Table of Requests (TOR) structure.

**Source URL**

This source code is implements CrashDump for the Whitley platform and supports the Ice Lake Server and Cooper Lake Server processors in private github [Intel-BMC/crashdump](https://github.com/Intel-BMC/crashdump/) that collects debug data from the processors over the PECI bus when executed.

**How to use**

* There are two ways to execute Crash Dump
  ```
  On-Demand (Trigger by Redfish)
  ```

  You can use below Redfish curl to trigger Crash Dump by On-Demand POST action.  
  This action is used to trigger a new On-Demand Crash Dump is returned immediately.
  > _/redfish/v1/Systems/system/LogServices/Crashdump/Actions/Oem/Crashdump.OnDemand_

  Eventually, there is crashdump file will exist in /tmp/crashdumps folder on BMC.  
  And **trigger_type** content in crashdump file is **On-Demand** that means the Crash Dump daemon be called by On-Demand.

  You can use below busctl command to verify Crash Dump by On-Demand.
  > _busctl call com.intel.crashdump /com/intel/crashdump/0 org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties Get ss "com.intel.crashdump" "Log"_

  ```
  Direct call upon detection of an Error Event (Trigger by Intel Host Error Monitor)
  ```

  The Intel Host Error Monitor [Intel-BMC/host-error-monitor](https://github.com/Intel-BMC/host-error-monitor) daemon is use to detect an host error event then trigger Crash Dump dameon be executed. And **trigger_type** content in crashdump file is **IERR** that means the Crash Dump daemon be called upon the BMC detecting an host error event.

* There are two ways to get crashdump file
  ```
  Redish
  ```

  Redfish url to get crashdump entries.  
  You can get crashdump file **crashdump_xxx.json** by clicking **Message** link directly.
  > _https://{bmc_ip}/redfish/v1/Systems/system/LogServices/Crashdump/Entries_

  ```
  WebUI
  ```

  Select `Event log` and select `Oem` in `Select system log type` on **WebUI**.  
  You can get crashdump file by clicking **Export** button.

**CScripts Crash Dump**

  CScripts (Customer Scripts) are a collection of scripts provided by Intel to assist customers with platform debug and validation. This is another method use CScripts function crashdump() to collect crash records manually. Use RunBMC Olympus as example:

**How to use**

* Configuring ASD on BMC and OpenIPC on Host (refer to [ASD](#asd))

* Inject 3Strike Error

  Injects a Three Strike Counter timeout, resulting in Machine Check Exception (MCE) and IERR.  
  Execute ei.injectThreeStrike command in cscripts folder
    > _>>> ei.injectThreeStrike_

* Collect crash records

  The crashdump feature allows the user to retrieve internal state of the cores after a 3Strike failure.  
  Collected data will be stored in JSON format name as **crashdump.json**  
  Execute crashdump() command in cscripts folder
    > _>>> crashdump()_

  The crashdump_decode_analyze feature allows the user to analyze any crashdump JSON file.  
  Analysis data will be stored in JSON format name as **crasdump_decoded.json**  
  Execute crashdump() command in cscripts folder
    > _>>> crashdump_decode_analyze(crashdump.json)_

# LDAP for User Management
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/b6fdec0d/openbmc/ldap-login-via-ssh.png">
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/access_ldap_via_bmc.png">

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

LDAP is specified in a series of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Standard Track publications called Request for Comments (RFCs), using the description language ASN.1.

A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords. This allows many different applications and services to connect to the LDAP server to validate users.

      ```

      > _Without these patches provided by Nuvoton, the privilege mapping and authentication procedure applied are predefined by OpenBMC._

    * Program the updated image into BMC.

5. Test LDAP server.

    * Connect BMC and LDAP server in same local network and power on it.
    * Log in BMC from the console program (like Tera Term) with the root account (root/0penBmc).
      > _The console program is used to display a debug console provided by BMC._

    * The IP address for the LDAP server is 192.168.0.101 for now.
    * Set up IP addresses for BMC and LDAP server so that they can ping each other.
      + For example, set BMC's IP address to 192.168.0.2. Input the following command in the console program.
        ```
        ifconfig eth2 192.168.0.2
        ```

        > _Please replace **192.168.0.2** with your IP configuration for BMC._

    * Execute the following command in the console program.
      ```
      ldapsearch -ZZ -h 192.168.0.101 -D "cn=admin,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com" -b "dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret
      ```
      > _Please replace **192.168.0.101** with your IP configuration for LDAP server._
      > _The ldapsearch example is to display all the data stored in the LDAP server using a TLS connection._

    * You could use the account **user1** stored in the LDAP server to log in WebUI running on BMC.

      + Some descriptions about the LDIF used by the LDAP server and authentication process are provided here. Please refer to the six snapshots in the following description.
        > _To login an account, the authentication logic has to check the following criteria._
        > _**bmc-uid**: It stands for the BMC machine that the account is used to login. The BMC machines are grouped by DN **ou=ap_group,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com**. One BMC machine can be in multiple groups at the same time. (see **ap_group** below)_

**LDAP user authentication and privilege mapping in OpenBMC**

The **How to use** part above is to introduce the Nuvoton customized authentication mechanism in addition to the LDAP server setup procedure.

In OpenBMC, PAM based authentication is implemented, so for both LDAP users and local users, the authentication flow is the same. For the LDAP user accounts, there is no LDAP attribute type that corresponds to the OpenBMC privilege roles. The preferred way is to group LDAP user accounts into LDAP groups. D-Bus API is provided for the user to assign privilege role to the LDAP group.

This section is to brief some characteristics about the LDAP user authentication and privilege mapping which are currently implmented in OpenBMC. For more information, please refer to [user_management.md](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/architecture/user_management.md#ldap).

1. Openbmc's LDAP user authentication is fulfilled by [bmcweb](https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb), [libpam](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/tree/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-extended/pam) and [nss-pam-ldapd](https://github.com/openbmc/meta-phosphor/tree/master/recipes-support/nss-pam-ldapd). 

2. By calling the function **pamAuthenticateUser**, bmcweb is able to authenticate the user from the ldap server via the pam configuration file **webserver** , the libpam module and nss-pam-ldapd.

3. The pam configuration file **webserver** requires the user to pass the predefined authentication criteria as described below.
    > _auth     include  common-auth_.  
    > _auth     required pam_succeed_if.so user ingroup redfish_.

4. The pam_succeed_if pam modules requires the login user to be a member of the **redfish** group.
    > _For more information, please refer to https://linux.die.net/man/8/pam_succeed_if_.  
    > _The snapshot below shows how the users are added in the **redfish** group via the **memberUid** column_.
    <img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/redfish_group_user.PNG">

5. The patch [pam_succeed_if_support_ldap_user_login.patch](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-extended/pam/libpam/pam_succeed_if_support_ldap_user_login.patch) provided by Nuvoton is to deal with the group name/id conflict when there are same group name/id between the **/etc/group** and ldap server for passing the pam_succeed_if module check.

6. The privilege role is a property of the user D-Bus object for the local users. For the LDAP user accounts, the privilege role will be based on the LDAP group. The LDAP group to privilege role mapping needs to be configured prior to authenticating with the LDAP user accounts. The following two example images show how to configure privilege role mapping and the result and the configuration steps are provided as well.

    <img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/create_mapping.PNG">
    <img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/mapping_example.PNG">

    > _Log in WebUI using root/0penBmc and navigate to `Access` menu item on the left panel_.  
    > _A sub menu item `LDAP` pops up and select it_.  
    > _Enable the checkbox `Enable LDAP authentication` on the right panel and set up the LDAP configuration in OpenBMC according to your LDAP server setting_.  
    > _Press `Save` button to enable the LDAP service_.  
    > _The `Add role group` button is available then and select it_.  
    > _A dialogue window `Add new role group` pops up, fill the group name and select the corresponding privilege according to your requirement_.  
    > _Press `Save` button of the dialogue window to create the privilege role mapping for the LDAP group just filled_.  
    > _Check if the privilege for a LDAP user is mapped properly by logging into WebUI with the account in the LDAP group just filled_.  
    > _If the account doesn't act as a Administrator, some pages inside the WebUI are not available_.

    > _To get privilege mapping via dbus, the user can input the following command in the debug console and get the output as shown by the following example image. The object path **/xyz/openbmc_project/user/ldap/openldap/role_map/1** is an example here_.  
        ```
        busctl introspect xyz.openbmc_project.Ldap.Config /xyz/openbmc_project/user/ldap/openldap/role_map/1
        ```

    <img width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/dbus_mapping_example.PNG">

7. An excerpt of [user_management.md](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/architecture/user_management.md#authorization-flow) about the ldap user's privilege is provided here, explains how the privilege roles of the user accounts are consumed by the webserver interface and some description is added.

    * Invoke PAM API for authenticating with user credentials. Proceed, if the authentication succeeds.
    * Check if the user is a local user account. If the user account is local, fetch the privilege role from the D-Bus object and update the session information.
    * If the user account is not local, read the group name for the user.
    * Fetch the privilege role corresponding to the group name, update the session information with the privilege role.
      + To deal with the group name/id conflict between **/etc/group** and the ldap server, a patch [0001-meta-quanta-meta-olympus-nuvoton-phosphor-user-manag.patch](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/users/phosphor-user-manager/0001-meta-quanta-meta-olympus-nuvoton-phosphor-user-manag.patch) is provided by Nuvoton.
    * If there is no mapping for group name to privilege role, default to user privilege role for the session.
    * The following images display the LDAP settings for a LDAP user (e.g.: user1) to act as a role of Administrator.
      + The **gidNumber** attribute for the account **user1** and the group **priv-admin** has to be identical.
      + Along with the patch [0001-meta-quanta-meta-olympus-nuvoton-phosphor-user-manag.patch](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-quanta/meta-olympus-nuvoton/recipes-phosphor/users/phosphor-user-manager/0001-meta-quanta-meta-olympus-nuvoton-phosphor-user-manag.patch), the user could avoid the conflict of the same group name like **priv-admin** between /etc/group and the ldap server.

### Intel At-Scale Debug
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/870d09e/openbmc/asd.png">
The Intel® At-Scale Debug feature allows for using any host system to run the Debug tool stack while connecting to the target system across the network. The target system must have a BMC which has physical connectivity to the JTAG pins as a minimum requirement of functionality.    

**How to use**

Here uses the RunBMC Olympus server as example.

1. switch JPC1 jumper on host to 2-3.
2. configure GPIO40(BMC_XDP_JTAG_SEL_N) to connect BMC JTAG to Host CPU
    ```
    echo 40 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio40/value
    ```
3. configure BMC_TCK_MUX_SEL pin to CPU TCK
    ```
    echo 22 > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value
    ```
4. Run ASD daemon on BMC
    ```
    asd -u -n eth1 --log-level=warning -p 5123
    ```
5. Launch CScripts on debug host
    ```
    Assume CScripts source folder = $CS, OpenIPC source folder = $OIPC
    Edit $OIPC/openipc/Config/SKX/SKX_ASD_RC-Pins.xml
    - Change ip address to BMC ip address
    Edit $OIPC/openipc/Config/OpenIpcConfig.xml
    - Change DefaultIpcConfig tag as <DefaultIpcConfig Name="SKX_ASD_RC-Pins"/>
    export IPC_PATH=$OIPC/openipc/Bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$IPC_PATH
    Go to $CS/cscripts, execute "python startCscripts.py -a ipc"
    ```
6. Execute OpenIPC idcode operation in CScripts command prompt. It will show the TAP device's idcode.
    ```
    >>> import ipccli
    >>> ipc = ipccli.baseaccess()
    >>> ipc.idcode(0)
    ```


### CPLD Programming
The motherboard on server have a CPLD device that can be upgraded firmware on it. BMC can load svf file to program CPLD via JTAG.  

**How to use**

run loadsvf on Runbmc to program CPLD. Specify the svf file name with -s.
```
loadsvf -d /dev/jtag0 -s firmware.svf
```

### HOST Tool
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/322d0d3/openbmc/in-band-fu.png">

The host-tool depends on `ipmi-blob-tool` and `pciutils`.

#### Building pciutils
Check out the [pciutils source](https://github.com/pciutils/pciutils).

Then run these commands in the source directory.
```
make SHARED=yes
make SHARED=yes install
make install-lib
```

#### Building ipmi-blob-tool
Check out the [ipmi-blob-tool source](https://github.com/openbmc/ipmi-blob-tool).
Then run these commands in the source directory.

```
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
make install
```

#### Building burn_my_bmc (the host-tool)
Check out the [phosphor-ipmi-flash source](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-ipmi-flash).
Then run these commands in the source directory.
If you choose "enable-nuvoton-p2a-vga", then the tool will support LPC and PCI-VGA.
If you choose "enable-nuvoton-p2a-mbox", then the tool will support LPC and PCI-MailBox

```
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --disable-build-bmc-blob-handler --enable-nuvoton-p2a-vga
make
make install
```

**How to use**
1. If you want to do firmware update over LPC, then you need to check the memory address which BIOS allocates for LPC.
You could use "ioport" tool and following commands to get the address.
    ```
    sudo outb 0x4e 0x07
    sudo outb 0x4f 0x0f

    # Host address a7-a0
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF4
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # Host address a15-a8
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF5
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # Host address a23-a16
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF6
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # Host address a32-a24
    sudo outb 0x4e 0xF7
    sudo inb 0x4f

    # shm active?
    sudo outb 0x4e 0x30
    sudo inb 0x4f

    ```

2. Here is an example for upadting over LPC, and --length is fixed.
    ```
    sudo ./burn_my_bmc --command update --interface ipmilpc --image image-bmc --sig image-bmc.sig --type image --address 0x817e0000 --length 0x1000
    ```

3. Here is an example for upadting over PCI(both VGA and MailBox)and --type is fixed
    ```
    sudo ./burn_my_bmc --command update --interface ipmipci --image image-bmc --sig image-bmc.sig --type image
    ```

### IPMI Library
This is an OpenBMC IPMI Library (Handler) for In-Band Firmware Update.

**How to use**
1. You need to enable the way you want to transfer data from host to BMC
    ```
    nuvoton-lpc
    enable-nuvoton-p2a-mbox
    enable-nuvoton-p2a-vga
    ```

2. select the corresponding address for IPMI_FLASH_BMC_ADDRESS_nuvoton
    ```
    0x7F400000
    0xF0848000
    0xc0008000
    ```
