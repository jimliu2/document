## System

### Sensor
[phosphor-hwmon](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon) daemon will periodically check the sensor reading to see if it exceeds lower bound or upper bound . If alarm condition is hit, the [phosphor-sel-logger](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-sel-logger) handles all sensor events to add new IPMI SEL records to the journal, [phosphor-host-ipmid](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/phosphor-host-ipmid) will convert the journal SEL records to IPMI SEL record format and reply to host.

### FRU
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/cab7306/openbmc/fru.png">

Field Replaceable Unit. The FRU Information is used to primarily to provide “inventory” information about the boards that the FRU Information Device is located on. In NPCM750, we connect EEPROM component as FRU Information Device to support this feature. Typically, this feature is used by the BMC to "monitor" host server health about H/W component's status.

**Source URL**

This is a patch for enabling FRU feature in [phosphor-impi-fru](https://github.com/openbmc/ipmi-fru-parser) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-buv-runbmc/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru_%25.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-buv-runbmc/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru_%25.bbappend)

**How to use**
* Modify DTS settings of EEPROM for FRU.
  For example about DTS **nuvoton-npcm750-evb.dts**:
  ```
  i2c4: i2c@84000 {
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <0>;
      bus-frequency = <100000>;
      status = "okay";
      eeprom@54 {
          compatible = "atmel,24c64";
          reg = <0x54>;
      };
  };
  ```

  According DTS modification, you also need to remember modify your EEPROM file description content about **SYSFS_PATH** and **FRUID**. Below is example for our EEPROM file description **[motherboard](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-buv-runbmc/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-fru/obmc/eeproms/system/chassis/motherboard)**:
  ```
  SYSFS_PATH=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0050/eeprom
  FRUID=1
  ```
  **SYSFS_PATH** is the path according your DTS setting and **FRUID** is arbitrary number but need to match **Fruid** in **[config.yaml](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-buv-runbmc/recipes-phosphor/configuration/olympus-nuvoton-yaml-config/olympus-nuvoton-ipmi-fru.yaml)** file. Below is example for when **Fruid** set as 1:
  ```
  1: #Fruid
    /system/chassis/motherboard:
      entityID: 7
      entityInstance: 1
      interfaces:
        xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.Asset:
          BuildDate:
            IPMIFruProperty: Mfg Date
            IPMIFruSection: Board
          PartNumber:
            IPMIFruProperty: Part Number
            IPMIFruSection: Board
          Manufacturer:
            IPMIFruProperty: Manufacturer

          SerialNumber:
            IPMIFruProperty: Serial Number
            IPMIFruSection: Board
        xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item:

          Version:
            IPMIFruProperty: FRU File ID
            IPMIFruSection: Board
  ```

* Server health

  Select `Server health` -> `Hardware status` on **Web-UI** will show FRU Board Info/Chassis Info/Product Info area.

### Fan PID Control
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e12e9dd/openbmc/fan_stepwise_pwm.png">
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/8fc19a1/openbmc/fan_rpms.png">

In NPCM750, we have two PWM modules and support eight PWM signals to control fans for dynamic adjustment according temperature variation.

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control)
* [https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon)

**How to use**

In order to automatically apply accurate and responsive correction to a fan control function, we use the `swampd` to handle output PWM signal. For enable this daemon, basically we need configuring the swampd configuration file and deploy a system service for start this daemon as below steps.

>_NOTICE: In current solution, we only use stepwise mechanism to control fans. But the swampd also can controls fan with PID by tuning parameters according to customer platform._

* The swampd(PID control daemon) is a Margin-based daemon running within the OpenBMC environment. It uses a well-defined [configuration file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-buv-runbmc/recipes-phosphor/fans/phosphor-pid-control/config-olympus-nuvoton.json) to control the temperature of the tray components to keep them within operating conditions.

    Here is a configuration example shows how to using one PWM control more than one fans on system.

        },
    ]
    ```
    The [PID README](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/master/configure.md) provide more detail about the meaning for each parameter.

    Roughly speaking, there are two main section in configuration file: **sensor** and **zones**.
    **Sensors** defined the all component which are involved PID like temperature sensors, or fans.
    **Zones** defined the mechanism how the swampd control each fans by setting parameters.

    The most important in **sensors** section is the settings of `readPath` and `writePath`.
    Sensors like temperature sensor or margin sensor must only set readPath, and fill up empty string to writePath.
    Fans could set the D-Bus path to readPath, also set the pwm system path to writePath.
    More detail about readPath and writePath please refer README that mentioned above.

    There are four PID controller types user can use: `fan`, `temp`, `margin`, and `stepwise` in **zones**.
    User can tune the PID parameters following the [tuning README](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/master/tuning.md). 

    In above example case, the fan PID controller has a lot of PID parameters. And we only use the stepwise controller to control whole zone, so the PID parameters in fan controller like `integralCoeff` or `outLim_max` would not work.
    And the parameter `inputs` for stepwise controller must be thermal sensor.
    Please note the parameter `setpoint` is no meaning for type `fan` and `stepwise` currently, and cannot be left out.

    If user want to control whole zone by stepwise controller like example configuration, the key point is set reading and output.
    The `stepwise` PID use the mapping of reading and output value instead of set RPM setpoint.
    The reading and output value should be a pair, and user can set 20 pairs in maximum, one more pairs at least.
    And the `stepwise` will return output setpoint if temperature **is larger** than reading value.
    For example, assume here are pairs of `stepwise` reading and output:
    ```
    {
      "reading": {25, 26, 27},
      "output": {10, 20, 30}
    }
    ```

    If the temperature reading is 25.5°C, the return value will be 10.
    And if the reading value is 26.5°C, the stepwise controller will set 20% RPM to fan(s).


* OpenBMC will run swampd through [phosphor-pid-control.service](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-buv-runbmc/recipes-phosphor/fans/phosphor-pid-control/phosphor-pid-control.service) that controls the fans by pre-defined zones. Here is a example service.
    ```
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/swampd
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5
    StartLimitInterval=0
    ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/fan-default-speed.sh
    ```
    + **ExecStopPost** that means an additional commands that are executed after the service is stopped.

### NTP Server
  Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.

  **systemd-timesyncd** is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an **SNTP (Simple NTP)** client. This daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with **systemd-networkd** to only operate when network connectivity is available.
        
  The modification time of the file **/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock** indicates the timestamp of the last successful synchronization (or at least the **systemd build date**, in case synchronization was not possible).
    
  **Source URL**
  * [https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-time-manager](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-time-manager)
  * [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync)
    

  **How to use**
  <img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/master/openbmc/Time.PNG">
  * Enable NTP by **Web-UI** `Server configuration`
      ->`Date and time settings`
  * Enable NTP by command
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp true  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**_ 
    
      If NTP is Enabled and network is Connected (Using **eth1** connect to router), we will see the item **systemd-timesyncd.service active** is **yes** and **System clock synchronized** is **yes**. Thus, system time will sync from NTP server to get current time.
  * Get NTP status  
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >Universal time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >**System clock synchronized: yes**  
      >**systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  
      
  * Disable NTP  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp false  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: no**_  
      
  * Using Local NTP server Configuration  
    When starting, systemd-timesyncd will read the configuration file from **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf**, which looks like as below: 
        >_[Time]  
        >\#NTP=  
        >\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_  
    
    	By default, systemd-timesyncd uses the Google Public NTP servers **time[1-4].google.com**, if no other NTP configuration is available. To add time servers or change the provided ones, **uncomment** the relevant line and list their host name or IP separated by a space. For example, we setup NB windows 10 system as NTP server with IP **192.168.1.128**  
    	>_[Time]  
    	>**NTP=192.168.1.128**  
    	>\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_
    
  * BMC connect to local NTP server of windows 10 system  
      Connect to NB through **eth1** EMAC interface, and set static IP **192.168.1.15**  
        
      ```
      ifconfig eth1 up
      ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.15
      ```
      >_Note: Before that you need to setup your NTP server (192.168.1.128) on Windows 10 system first_  
      
      Modify **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf** file on BMC as we mentioned
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**_  
      
      Re-start NTP to make effect about our configuration change  
      ```
      systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
      ```
      Check status of NTP that show already synced to our local time server 
      ```
      systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service -l --no-pager
      ```
      >_Status: "Synchronized to time server 192.168.1.128:123 (192.168.1.128)."_  
      
      Verify **Web-UI** `Server overview`->`BMC time` whether sync from NTP server as same as **timedatectl**. (Note: timedatectl time zone default is UTC, thus you will find the BMC time is UTC+8)
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```

      >Universal time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >System clock synchronized: yes  
      >systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_

  * TimeZone  
      According OpenBMC current design that only support UTC TimeZone now, we can use below command to get current support TimeZone on BMC
      ```
      timedatectl list-timezones
      ```

### IPMI SOL
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/8afa8a2/openbmc/sol_ipmi_win10.PNG">

The Serial over LAN (SoL) via IPMI redirects the output of the server’s serial port to a command/terminal window on your workstation.

The user uses the ipmi tool like [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) to interact with SOL via IPMI. Here the ipmiutil is used as an example.

The patch integrates [phosphor-net-ipmid](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/runbmc/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-buv-runbmc/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-net_%25.bbappend) into Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution for OpenBMC.

**How to use**

1. Download the [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) according to the host OS in your workstation.

   > _Here it's assumed that the host OS is Windows 10 and ipmiutil for Windows is downloaded and used accordingly._

2. Run SOL:

    * Extract or install the ipmiutil package to a folder in your workstation in advance.
    * Launch a command window and navigate to that folder.
    * Input the following command in the command window.
      ```
      ipmiutil sol -N 192.168.0.2 -U root -P 0penBmc -J 3 -V 4 -a
      ```
    * (Optional) Configure the `Properties` of the command window to see the entire output of SOL.
      > _Screen Buffer Size Width: 200_
        _Screen Buffer Size Height: 400_
        _Window Size Width: 100_
        _Window Size Height: 40_

4. End SOL session:

    * Press the "~" key (using the shift key + "`" key) and "." key at the same time in the command window.
    * Input the following command in the command window.
      ```
      ipmiutil sol -N 192.168.0.2 -U root -P 0penBmc -J 3 -V 4 -d
      ```

### CPLD Programming
BMC can load svf file to program CPLD via JTAG.  

BUV can use J705 pin5 , pin7 , pin9 , pin13 to connect CPLD.


**How to use**

run loadsvf on RunBMC to program CPLD. Specify the svf file name with -s.
```
loadsvf -d /dev/jtag0 -s firmware.svf
```
